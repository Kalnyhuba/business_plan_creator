The name of the company is Qolt. It is a food delivery company based in Aalborg, Denmark. We provide delivery of groceries and restaurant food.
We operate in the services sector, more specifically the food industry and the delivery services. It is a combination of both. Target markets could include any age range between 16 and 70, who would like to order take away food and can afford it.
In Denmark we face competition by two major companies, Wolt and JustEat. These are both bigger companies than us, with higher market share.
We propose a fast and accurate food delivery service right to the customer's doorstep.
We mostly advertise on social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook and Youtube, but rarely we pay for adverts in the city centrum on billboards or posts.
The initial investment amount for the establishment was 5 million Danish krona, and the marketing budget is around 2 million krona per year. We generate profits by providing a platform for the restaurants and stores to sell their products online and we take a cut from each sale and also charge the customer a small fee for delivery fee.
